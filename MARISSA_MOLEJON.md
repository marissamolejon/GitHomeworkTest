1. I am Marissa Molejon.

2. My favorite sport is volleyball. I started playing indoor volleyball when I was 14, back in high school, and it quickly became a big part of my life. Over the years, it’s taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to stay focused under pressure. When I moved to Barcelona, I discovered beach volleyball, and it brought a whole new level of fun and freedom to the game. I love the feeling of playing outdoors by the sea — it’s more relaxed, social, and gives me a sense of energy and connection that keeps me coming back.

3. My favorite food is Sushi. I like it because it’s light, healthy, and full of flavor. I enjoy the mix of textures and how fresh the ingredients taste. Sushi also reminds me of balance — it’s simple but carefully made. Whether it’s classic rolls or sashimi, I never get tired of it because it always feels satisfying and fresh.
   
4. Here's the link to my favorite song is - I’ve loved it since I was younger because of its calm melody and heartfelt lyrics. It’s the kind of song that makes me feel peaceful and nostalgic every time I listen to it.

5. An interesting fact about me is that I’ve lived in five different countries throughout my life. I was born and raised in the Philippines, after I finished my associate degree. In 2012, I moved to Norway to study the language and worked until 2015. After that, I lived in Denmark for two years as a cultural exchange student, then spent a year in the Netherlands and worked. Since 2019, I’ve been living in Spain. Experiencing different cultures has taught me to be open-minded, adaptable, and curious about the world. Each place I’ve called home has shaped who I am and given me a deeper appreciation for diversity and connection.
